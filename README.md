# GSIS
Ground Station Integration Software
For this code to function properly please make sure to put the GSIS folder in your home directory. 

This code is used by Colorado space grant to allow for tracking, rotor control, and downlink from NOAA satellites with hope to add more in the near future using and hackrf sdr. This code can easily be altered to work with a different sdr by editing the GNURadioCode source to UHD instead of osmocom. See documentation folder for more info on how to configure your machine to run the code, due to dependancies you are unable to run code without installing other programs first. The hope is to add a setup file to the code in the future that downloads all dependancies however for now this is a manual process.
