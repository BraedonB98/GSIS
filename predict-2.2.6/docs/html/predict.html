<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREDICT</b>
is a multi-user satellite tracking and orbital prediction
program written under the Linux operating system by John A.
Magliacane, KD2BD. <b>PREDICT</b> is free software. You can
redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation, either version 2 of the License or any later
version.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREDICT</b>
is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.</p>

<h2>FIRST TIME USE
<a name="FIRST TIME USE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREDICT</b>
tracks and predicts passes of satellites based on the
geographical location of the ground station, the current
date and time as provided by the computer system&rsquo;s
clock, and Keplerian orbital data for the satellites of
interest to the ground station. First time users of
<b>PREDICT</b> are provided default ground station location
and orbital data information files. These files are managed
by the program, and are normally located in a user&rsquo;s
home directory under a hidden subdirectory named
<i>.predict</i>. First time users will be prompted to supply
<b>PREDICT</b> with their geographical location (the same as
selecting option <b>[G]</b> from the program&rsquo;s main
menu) the first time the program is run. Latitude is
normally expressed in degrees north with latitudes south of
the equator expressed in negative degrees. Longitude is
normally expressed in degrees west with eastern longitudes
expressed in negative degrees. This behavior can be modified
by passing the <i>-east</i> or <i>-south</i> commmand line
switches to <b>PREDICT</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Latitudes and
longitudes may be either entered in decimal degrees, or in
degrees, minutes, seconds (DMS) format. Station altitude is
entered as the number of meters the ground station is
located above sea level. This parameter is not very
critical. If unsure, make a realistic guess or simply enter
0.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Users of
<b>PREDICT</b> need Keplerian orbital data for the
satellites they wish to track that is preferably no older
than one month. The default orbital data supplied with the
program is liable to be quite old, and so must be brought up
to date if accurate results are to be expected. This may be
accomplished by selecting option <b>[E]</b> from
<b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> main menu and manually entering
Keplerian data for each satellite in the program&rsquo;s
database, or by selecting option <b>[U]</b> and specifying a
file containing recent 2-line Keplerian element data sets
that correspond to the satellites in the program&rsquo;s
database. Keplerian orbital data is available from a variety
of sources, including <i>http://www.celestrak.com/</i>,
<i>http://www.space-track.org/</i>, and
<i>http://www.amsat.org/</i>.</p>

<h2>PROGRAM OPERATION
<a name="PROGRAM OPERATION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The start-up
screen of <b>PREDICT</b> lists the program&rsquo;s main
functions. Several tracking and orbital prediction modes are
available, as well as several utilities to manage the
program&rsquo;s orbital database.</p>

<h2>PREDICTING SATELLITE PASSES
<a name="PREDICTING SATELLITE PASSES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Orbital
predictions are useful for determining in advance when a
satellite is expected to come within range of a ground
station. They can also be used to look back to previous
passes to help to confirm or identify past observations.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREDICT</b>
includes two orbital prediction modes to predict any pass
above a ground station (main menu option <b>[P]</b>), or
list only those passes that might be visible to a ground
station through optical means (main menu option <b>[V]</b>).
In either mode, the user is asked to select a satellite of
interest from a menu, and then asked to enter the date and
time (in UTC) at which prediction calculations should
start.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The current
date and time may be selected by default by entering nothing
and hitting simply the ENTER key when prompted to enter the
starting date and time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Otherwise, the
starting date and time should be entered in the form:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="7%"></td>
<td width="85%">


<p><i>DDMonYY HH:MM:SS</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Entering the
time is optional. If it is omitted, midnight (00:00:00) is
assumed. Once complete, orbital calculations are started and
prediction information is displayed on the screen.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The date and
time in UTC, along with the satellite&rsquo;s elevation
above ground, azimuth heading, modulo 256 orbital phase,
sub-satellite point latitude and longitude, slant range
between the ground station and the satellite, and the
satellite&rsquo;s orbit number are all displayed. If
spacecraft attitude parameters (ALAT, ALON) are included in
<b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> transponder database file, then
spacecraft antenna squint angles are displayed instead of
orbit numbers in the orbital prediction output.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An asterisk (*)
displayed to the right of the orbit number or squint angle
means the satellite is in sunlight at the date and time
listed on the line. A plus symbol (+) means the satellite is
in sunlight while the ground station is under the cover of
darkness at the time and date listed. Under good viewing
conditions, large satellites such as the International Space
Station (ISS), the US Space Shuttles, and Hubble Space
Telescope, and the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite
(UARS) are visible to the naked eye. If no symbol appears to
the right of each line, then the satellite is in the
Earth&rsquo;s shadow at the time and date listed, and is not
receiving any illumination from the sun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pressing the
<b>ENTER</b> key, the &rsquo;<b>Y</b>&rsquo; key, or the
space bar advances the orbital predictions to a screen
listing the next available passes. Pressing the
&rsquo;<b>L</b>&rsquo; key allows the currently displayed
screen plus any subsequent screens to be logged to a text
file in your current working directory. The name given to
this file is the name of the satellite plus a
&quot;.txt&quot; extension. Any slashes or spaces appearing
in the satellite name are replaced by the underscore (_)
symbol. The logging feature may be toggled on and off at any
time by pressing the or hitting the <b>ESC</b>ape key will
also close the log file. The log file will be appended with
additional information if additional predictions are
conducted for the same satellite with the logging feature
turned on.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Selecting
<b>[V]</b> from <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> main menu will permit
a ground station to only predict passes for satellites that
are potentially visible through optical means. Since all
other passes are filtered out in this mode, and since some
satellites may never arrive over a ground station when
optical viewing conditions are possible, the program
provides the option of breaking out of visual orbital
prediction mode by pressing the <b>[ESC]</b>ape key as
calculations are made. A prompt is displayed at the bottom
of the screen to alert the user of this option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In either
orbital prediction mode, predictions will not be attempted
for satellites that can never rise above the ground
station&rsquo;s horizon, or for satellites in geostationary
orbits. If a satellite is in range at the starting date and
time specified, <b>PREDICT</b> will adjust the starting date
back in time until the point of AOS so that the prediction
screen displays the first pass in its entirety from start to
finish.</p>

<h2>SINGLE SATELLITE TRACKING MODE
<a name="SINGLE SATELLITE TRACKING MODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
predicting satellite passes, <b>PREDICT</b> allows
satellites to be tracked in real-time using
<b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> Single Satellite Tracking Mode (main
menu option <b>[T]</b>), or simultaneously as a group of 24
using the program&rsquo;s Multi-Satellite Tracking Mode
(main menu option <b>[M]</b>). The positions of the Sun and
Moon are also displayed when tracking satellites in
real-time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Selecting
option <b>[T]</b> from <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> main menu
places the program in Single Satellite Tracking Mode. The
user will be prompted to select the satellite of interest,
after which a screen will appear and display tracking
positions for the satellite selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In Single
Satellite Tracking Mode, a wealth of information related to
tracking a spacecraft and communicating through its
transponder is displayed. The current date and time is
displayed along with the satellite&rsquo;s sub-satellite
point, its orbital altitude in both kilometers and statute
miles, the slant range distance between the ground station
and the satellite in both kilometers and statute miles, the
current azimuth and elevation headings toward the satellite,
the orbital velocity of the satellite in both kilometers per
hour and statute miles per hour, the footprint of the
satellite in both kilometers and statute miles, the modulo
256 orbital phase of the satellite, the eclipse depth, the
spacecraft antenna squint angle, and orbital model in use,
as well as the current orbit number are also displayed. The
date and time for the next AOS is also provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Additionally,
if the satellite is currently in range of the ground
station, the amount of Doppler shift experienced on uplink
and downlink frequencies, path loss, propagation delay, and
echo times are also displayed. The expected time of LOS is
also provided.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Uplink and
downlink frequencies are held in <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b>
transponder database file <i>predict.db</i> located under
<i>$HOME/.predict</i>. A default file is provided with
<b>PREDICT</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Transponders
may be selected by pressing the SPACE BAR. The passband of
the transponder may be tuned in 1 kHz increments by pressing
the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> keys. 100 Hz tuning is
possible using the <b>,</b> and <b>.</b> keys. (These are
simply the <b>&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;</b> keys without the
SHIFT key.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If no
transponder information is available, the data displayed on
the tracking screen is abbreviated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The features
available in the Single Satellite Tracking Mode make it
possible to accurately determine the proper uplink frequency
to yield a given downlink frequency, or vice versa. For
example, if one wishes to communicate with a station heard
on 435.85200 MHz via FO-29, then 435.85200 MHz can be
selected via the keyboard as an RX frequency using the
tuning keys while tracking FO-29, and the corresponding
ground station TX frequency will be displayed by
<b>PREDICT</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Obviously, an
accurate system clock and up-to-date orbital data are
required for the best tuning accuracy.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a sound card
is present on your machine and the Single Satellite Tracking
Mode is invoked with an uppercase &rsquo;<b>T</b>&rsquo;
rather than a lowercase &rsquo;<b>t</b>&rsquo;,
<b>PREDICT</b> will make periodic voice announcements
stating the satellite&rsquo;s tracking coordinates in
real-time. Announcements such as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>&quot;This
is PREDICT. Satellite is at fifty six degrees azimuth and
forty five degrees elevation, and is approaching. Satellite
is currently visible.&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">are made at
intervals that are a function of how quickly the satellite
is moving across the sky. Announcements can occur as
frequently as every 50 seconds for satellites in low earth
orbits such as the International Space Station (370 km), or
as infrequently as every 8 minutes for satellites in very
high orbits, such as the AMC-6 geostationary satellite
(35780 km). Voice announcements are performed as background
processes so as not to interfere with tracking calculations
as the announcements are made. Alarms and special
announcements are made when the satellite being tracked
enters into or out of eclipse. Regular announcements can be
forced by pressing the &rsquo;<b>T</b>&rsquo; key in Single
Satellite Tracking Mode.</p>

<h2>MULTI-SATELLITE TRACKING MODE
<a name="MULTI-SATELLITE TRACKING MODE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Selecting
<b>[M]</b> from <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> main menu places the
program in a real-time multi-satellite tracking mode. In
this mode, all 24 satellites in the program&rsquo;s database
are tracked simultaneously along with the positions of the
Sun and Moon. Tracking data for the satellites is displayed
in two columns of 12 satellites each. The name, azimuth
heading, elevation, sub-satellite point latitude (in degrees
North) and longitude (in degrees West) positions are
provided, along with the slant range distance between the
satellite and the ground station (in kilometers).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A letter
displayed to the right of the slant range indicates the
satellite&rsquo;s sunlight and eclipse conditions. If the
satellite is experiencing an eclipse period, an <b>N</b> is
displayed. If the satellite is in sunlight and the ground
station is under the cover of darkness, a <b>V</b> is
displayed to indicate the possibility that the satellite is
visible under the current conditions. If the satellite is in
sunlight while conditions at the ground station do not allow
the satellite to be seen, a <b>D</b> is displayed.
Satellites in range of the ground station are displayed in
<b>BOLD</b> lettering. The AOS dates and times for the next
three satellites predicted to come into range are displayed
on the bottom of the screen between the tracking coordinates
of the Sun and Moon. Predictions are not made for satellites
in geostationary orbits or for satellites so low in
inclination and/or altitude that they can never rise above
the horizon of the ground station.</p>

<h2>SOLAR ILLUMINATION PREDICTIONS
<a name="SOLAR ILLUMINATION PREDICTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Selecting
<b>[S]</b> from <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> main menu will allow
solar illumination predictions to be made. These predictions
indicate how much sunlight a particular satellite will
receive in a 24 hour period. This information is especially
valuable to spacecraft designers and satellite ground
station controllers who must monitor spacecraft power
budgets or thermal conditions on-board their spacecraft due
to sunlight and eclipse periods. It can even be used to
predict the optimum times for astronauts to perform
extra-vehicular activities in space. Solar illumination
predictions may be logged to a file in the same manner that
orbital predictions may be logged (by pressing
<b>L</b>).</p>

<h2>SOLAR AND LUNAR ORBITAL PREDICTIONS
<a name="SOLAR AND LUNAR ORBITAL PREDICTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
making orbital predictions of spacecraft, <b>PREDICT</b> can
also predict transits of the Sun and the Moon. Lunar
predictions are initiated by selecting <b>[L]</b> from
<b>PREDICT</b>&rsquo;s Main Menu. Solar predictions are
selected through Main Menu option <b>[O]</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When making
solar and lunar orbital predictions, <b>PREDICT</b> provides
azimuth and elevation headings, the right ascension,
declination, Greenwich Hour Angle (GHA), radial velocity,
and normalized distance (range) to the Sun or Moon.
Declination and Greenwich Hour Angle correspond to the
latitude and longitude of the object&rsquo;s sub-satellite
point above the Earth&rsquo;s surface. The radial velocity
corresponds to the speed and direction the object is
traveling toward (+) or away (-) from the ground station,
and is expressed in meters per second. When the radial
distance of the Moon is close to zero, the amount of Doppler
shift experienced in Moonbounce communications is minimal.
The normalized distance corresponds to the object&rsquo;s
actual distance to the ground station divided its average
distance. In practice, the normalized distance can range
from about 0.945 to 1.055 for the Moon, and about 0.983 to
1.017 for the Sun.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Note that the
effects of atmospherics are ignored in determining the
elevation angles for the Sun and Moon. Furthermore, the data
provided by <b>PREDICT</b> corresponds to the object&rsquo;s
center, and not the upper or lower limb, as is sometimes
done when predicting the rising and setting times of these
celestial objects.</p>

<h2>OPERATION UNDER THE X-WINDOW SYSTEM
<a name="OPERATION UNDER THE X-WINDOW SYSTEM"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREDICT</b>
may be run under the X-Window System by invoking it through
the <i>xpredict</i> script contained with this software.
<i>xpredict</i> can invoke <i>rxvt</i>, <i>xterm</i>,
<i>Eterm</i>, <i>gnome-terminal</i>, or <i>kvt</i>, and
display <b>PREDICT</b> in a virtual terminal window.
<i>xpredict</i> should be edited for best results. In many
cases, holding down the SHIFT key while pressing the plus
(+) and minus (-) keys allows <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> window
to be re-sized when started under <i>xpredict</i>.</p>

<h2>COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
<a name="COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>PREDICT</b> reads ground station location and orbital
data information from a pair of files located in the
user&rsquo;s home directory under a hidden subdirectory
named <i>.predict</i>. Ground station location information
is held in a file named <i>predict.qth</i>, while orbital
data information for 24 satellites is held in a file named
<i>predict.tle</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If we wish to
run <b>PREDICT</b> using data from alternate sources instead
of these default files, the names of such files may be
passed to <b>PREDICT</b> on the command line when the
program is started. For example, if we wish to read the TLE
file <i>visual.tle</i> and the QTH file
<i>beach_house.qth</i> rather than the default files, we
could start <b>PREDICT</b> and pass the names of these
alternate files to the program in the following manner:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -t visual.tle -q beach_house.qth</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">or</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -q beach_house.qth -t visual.tle</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If the files
specified are not located in the current working directory,
then their relative or absolute paths should also be
specified along with their names (<i>predict -t
/home/kd2bd/orbs/visual.tle</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to specify only one alternate file while using the
default for the other. For example,</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -t visual.tle</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reads QTH
information from the default <i>~/.predict/predict.qth</i>
location, and TLE information from <i>visual.tle</i>,
while</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -q bobs.qth</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">reads QTH
information from <i>bobs.qth</i> and TLE information from
the default <i>~/.predict/predict.tle</i> location.</p>

<h2>QUIET ORBITAL DATABASE UPDATES
<a name="QUIET ORBITAL DATABASE UPDATES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to update <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> satellite orbital
database using another command line option that updates the
database from a NASA two-line element data set.
<b>PREDICT</b> then quietly exits without displaying
anything to the screen, thereby eliminating the need for
entering the program and selecting the appropriate menu
options. This option is invoked using the <i>-u</i> command
line switch as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -u orbs248.tle</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
updates <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> default orbital database with
the Keplerian elements found in the file <i>orbs248.tle</i>.
<b>PREDICT</b> may be updated from a list of files as
well:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -u amateur.tle visual.tle weather.tle</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If an alternate
datafile requires updating, it may also be specified on the
command line using the <i>-t</i> switch as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -t oscar.tle -u amateur.tle</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This example
updates the <i>oscar.tle</i> orbital database with the
two-line element data contained in <i>amateur.tle</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These options
permit the automatic update of <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b>
orbital data files using Keplerian orbital data obtained
through automatic means such as FTP, HTTP, or pacsat
satellite download.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For example,
the following script can be used to update
<b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> orbital database via the
Internet:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><tt>#!/bin/sh

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREDICT</b>
is compatible with serial port antenna rotator interfaces
conforming to the EasyComm 2 protocol standard. This
includes the PIC/TRACK interface developed by Vicenzo

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Using any of
these hardware interfaces, <b>PREDICT</b> can automatically
control the position of AZ/EL antenna rotators, and keep
antennas accurately pointed toward a satellite being tracked
by <b>PREDICT</b>. In operation, tracking data from
<b>PREDICT</b> is directed to the specified serial port
using the <i>-a</i> command line option. For example:</p>

</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The <i>-f</i>
command-line option, when followed by a satellite name or
object number and starting date/time, allows <b>PREDICT</b>
to respond with satellite positional information. This
feature allows <b>PREDICT</b> to be invoked within other
applications that need to determine the location of a
satellite at a particular point in time, such as the
location of where a CCD camera image was taken by a Pacsat
satellite based on its timestamp.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The information
produced includes the date/time in Unix format (the number
of seconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970), the
date/time in ASCII (UTC), the elevation of the satellite in
degrees, the azimuth heading of the satellite, the orbital
phase (modulo 256), the latitude and longitude of the
satellite&rsquo;s sub-satellite point at the time specified,
the slant range to the satellite in kilometers with respect
to the ground station&rsquo;s location, the orbit number,
and the spacecraft&rsquo;s sunlight visibility
information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The date/time
must be specified in Unix format (number of seconds since
midnight UTC on January 1, 1970). If no starting or ending
time is specified, the current date/time is assumed and a
single line of output is produced. If a starting and ending
time are specified, a list of coordinates beginning at the
starting time/date and ending with the ending time/date will
be returned by the program with a one second resolution. If
the letter <i>m</i> is appended to the ending time/date,
then the data returned by the program will have a one minute
resolution. The <i>-o</i> option allows the program to write
the calculated data to an output file rather than directing
it to the standard output device if desired.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The proper

<h2>SERVER MODE
<a name="SERVER MODE"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b>
network socket interface allows the program to operate as a
server capable of providing tracking data and other
information to client applications using the UDP protocol.
It is even possible to have the <b>PREDICT</b> server and
client applications running on separate machines provided
the clients are connected to the server through a
functioning network connection. The <i>-s</i> switch is used
to start <b>PREDICT</b> in server mode:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -s</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default,
<b>PREDICT</b> uses socket port 1210 for communicating with
client applications. Therefore, the following line needs to
be added to the end your <i>/etc/services</i> file:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict 1210/udp</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The port number
(1210) can be changed to something else if desired. There is
no need to recompile the program if it is changed. To run
more than one instance of <b>PREDICT</b> in server mode on a
single host, an alternate port must be specified when
invoking the additional instances of <b>PREDICT</b>. This
can be accomplished by using the <i>-n</i> switch:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="8%"></td>
<td width="92%">


<p><i>predict -n 1211 -t other_tle_file -s</i></p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When invoked in
server mode, <b>PREDICT</b> immediately enters
Multi-Satellite Tracking Mode, and makes live tracking data
available to clients. Clients may poll <b>PREDICT</b> for
tracking data when the program is running in either the
Multi-Satellite or Single Satellite Tracking Mode. When in
Multi-Satellite Tracking mode, tracking data for any of the
24 satellites in the program&rsquo;s database may be
accessed by client applications. When in Single-Satellite
Tracking mode, only live tracking data for the single
satellite being tracked may be accessed. Either tracking
mode may be ended at any time. When this is done,
<b>PREDICT</b> will return the last calculated satellite
tracking data until the program is again put into a
real-time tracking mode. This allows the user to return to
the main menu, and use other features of the program without
sending potentially harmful data to client applications.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The best way to
write a client application is to use the demonstration
program (demo.c) included in this distribution of
<b>PREDICT</b> as a guide. The sample program has comments
to explain how each component operates. It is useful to pipe
the output of this program through <i>less</i> to easily
browse through the data returned (<i>demo | less</i>).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In operation, a
character array is filled with the command and arguments to
be sent to <b>PREDICT</b>. A socket connection is then
opened, the request is sent, a response is received, and the
socket connection is closed. The command and arguments are
in ASCII text format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Several
excellent network client applications are included in this
release of <b>PREDICT</b>, and may be found under the
<i>predict/clients</i> directory.</p>

<h2>ADDING SATELLITES
<a name="ADDING SATELLITES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">One of the most
frequently asked questions is how satellites in
<b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> orbital database may be added,
modified, or replaced. As it turns out, there are several
ways in which this can be done. Probably the easiest is to
manually edit your <i>~/.predict/predict.tle</i> file, and
replace an existing satellite&rsquo;s entry with 2-line
Keplerian data for the new satellite. If this method is
chosen, however, just make sure to include ONLY the two line
data, and nothing else.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Another way is
to is select the Keyboard Edit option from the
program&rsquo;s Main Menu, select a satellite you wish to
replace. Edit the name and object number (replacing the old
information with the new information). Just hit ENTER, and
accept all the other orbital parameters shown. Get back to
<b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b> Main Menu. Select Auto Update, and
then enter the filename containing the 2-line element data
for your favorite new satellite. The new satellite data
should be detected by <b>PREDICT</b>, and the orbital data
for the old satellite will be overwritten by the new
data.</p>

<h2>NEAT TRICKS
<a name="NEAT TRICKS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
tracking and predicting passes of satellites, <b>PREDICT</b>
may also be used to generate a NASA two-line Keplerian
element data set from data entered via keyboard. For
example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re listening to Space
Shuttle audio re-broadcasts via WA3NAN and Keplerian
elements for the Space Shuttle&rsquo;s orbit are given by
the announcer. The orbital data provided by WA3NAN in verbal
form may be manually entered into <b>PREDICT&rsquo;s</b>
orbital database using option <b>[E]</b> of the
program&rsquo;s main menu (Keyboard Edit of Orbital
Database). The orbital data for the Space Shuttle in NASA
two-line element form can then be found in your orbital
database file, and may imported to any other satellite
tracking program that accepts two-line element files or
distributed to others electronically in this format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is also
possible to run <b>PREDICT</b> as a background process and
direct its display to an unused virtual console by using the
following command:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>predict &lt;
/dev/tty8 &gt; /dev/tty8 &amp;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Switching to
virtual console number 8 (ALT-F8 in text mode) will allow
<b>PREDICT</b> to be controlled and displayed even after
you&rsquo;ve logged out. This is especially handy when
running <b>PREDICT</b> in server mode on a remote
machine.</p>

<h2>GLOSSARY OF TERMS
<a name="GLOSSARY OF TERMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The following
terms are frequently used in association with satellite
communications and space technology:</p>

<h2>AOS:
<a name="AOS:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Acquisition of
Signal - the time at which a ground station first acquires
radio signals from a satellite. <b>PREDICT</b> defines AOS
as the time when the satellite being tracked comes within
+/- 0.03 degrees of the local horizon, although it may have
to rise higher than this before signals are first heard.</p>

<h2>Apogee:
<a name="Apogee:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Point in a
satellite&rsquo;s orbit when the satellite is at its
farthest distance from the earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>

<h2>Anomalistic Period:
<a name="Anomalistic Period:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A satellite
orbital parameter specifying the time between successive
perigees.</p>

<h2>Ascending Node:
<a name="Ascending Node:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Point in a
satellite&rsquo;s orbit when its sub-satellite point crosses
the equator moving south to north.</p>

<h2>Azimuth:
<a name="Azimuth:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The compass
direction measured clockwise from true north. North = 0
degrees, East = 90 degrees, South = 180 degrees, and West =
270 degrees.</p>

<h2>Descending Node:
<a name="Descending Node:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Point in a
satellite&rsquo;s orbit when its sub-satellite point crosses
the equator moving north to south.</p>

<h2>Doppler Shift:
<a name="Doppler Shift:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The motion of a
satellite in its orbit around the earth, and in many cases
the rotational motion of the earth itself, causes radio
signals generated by satellites to be received on Earth at
frequencies slightly different than those upon which they
were transmitted. <b>PREDICT</b> calculates what effect
these motions have upon the reception of satellites
transmitting on the 146 MHz and 435 MHz Amateur Radio
bands.</p>

<h2>Elevation:
<a name="Elevation:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The angle
between the local horizon and the position of the satellite.
A satellite that appears directly above a particular
location is said to be located at an elevation of 90
degrees. A satellite located on the horizon of a particular
location is said to be located at an elevation of 0 degrees.
A satellite with an elevation of less than zero is
positioned below the local horizon, and radio communication
with a satellite in such a position is not possible under
normal circumstances.</p>

<h2>Footprint:
<a name="Footprint:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Diameter of the
Earth&rsquo;s surface visible from a satellite. The higher
the satellite&rsquo;s orbital altitude, the greater the
footprint, and the wider the satellite&rsquo;s
communications coverage.</p>

<h2>LOS:
<a name="LOS:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Loss of Signal
- the time at which a ground station loses radio contact
with a satellite. <b>PREDICT</b> defines LOS as the time
when the satellite being tracked comes within +/- 0.03
degrees of the local horizon.</p>

<h2>Orbital Phase:
<a name="Orbital Phase:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">An orbital
&quot;clock&quot; that describes a satellite&rsquo;s orbital
position with respect to perigee. Orbital Phase may be
modulo 256, or modulo 360, and is sometimes referred to as
mean anomaly when speaking of amateur radio satellites in
elliptical orbits, such as the Phase 3 satellites. Orbital
phase is zero at perigee.</p>

<h2>Path Loss:
<a name="Path Loss:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The apparent
attenuation a radio signal undergoes as it travels a given
distance. This attenuation is the result of the dispersion
radio waves experience as they propagate between transmitter
and receiver using antennas of finite gain. Free space path
loss is technically an oxymoron since free space is loss
free.</p>

<h2>Perigee:
<a name="Perigee:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Point in a
satellite&rsquo;s orbit when the satellite is at its closest
distance to the earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>

<h2>Nodal Period:
<a name="Nodal Period:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A satellite
orbital parameter specifying the time between successive
ascending nodes.</p>

<h2>Slant Range:
<a name="Slant Range:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The straight
line distance between the ground station and the satellite
at a given time.</p>

<h2>Sub-Satellite Point:
<a name="Sub-Satellite Point:"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The latitude
and longitude specifying the location on the Earth that is
directly below the satellite.</p>
